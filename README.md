# Sport-Injury-Analysis

# Brief Introduction
For this Analysis, I stepped into the role of a sports data analyst to analyze injury patterns and uncover actionable insights that sports teams and medical staff can use to reduce injury risk and improve athlete welfare.

Here, I identify the most frequent injury, injury occurrence and recurrence rate, recovery speed index, treatment effectiveness rate and provided recommendations to prevent common injuries and enhance athlete recovery.

# About The Dataset 
The dataset had over 15,000 sport injury records and 8 tables - Injury Type, Player, Club, Coach, Event, Location, Treatment and Fact Injury tables which came in CSV format. Data transformation and analysis was done using Power Query and Power BI
