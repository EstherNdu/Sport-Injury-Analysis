# Sport-Injury-Analysis

# Brief Introduction
For this Analysis, I stepped into the role of a sports data analyst to analyze injury patterns and uncover actionable insights that sports teams and medical staff can use to reduce injury risk and improve athlete welfare.

Here, I identify the most frequent injury, injury occurrence and recurrence rate, recovery speed index, treatment effectiveness rate and provided recommendations to prevent common injuries and enhance athlete recovery.


# About The Dataset 
The dataset had over 15,000 sport injury records and 8 tables - Injury Type, Player, Club, Coach, Event, Location, Treatment and Fact Injury tables which came in CSV format. Data transformation and analysis was done using Power Query and Power BI


# Problem Question

* Injury Occurrence

  Create an injury occurrence report that shows injury occurrence across different sport type, injury type and demographics.

* Recovery & Recurrence Analysis

  Show how recovery and recurrence varied across different injury types, severe cases and demographics.

# Tool Used
  Power BI

# Processes 
* Imported CSV files into Power BI
* Transformed the data using Power Query
* Loaded the data into Power BI for Analysis & Reporting
* Created a Date Table
* Modeled the data
* Used DAX to perform indepth analysis
* Calculated the following using DAX: Avg Recovery time, recurrence rate, recovery speed index, treatment effectiveness rate,
  Injury rate e.t.c
* Created report wireframe in Light and Dark version using Power BI
* Created interactive reports

Note that the injury rate is per 1000 mins played

* Boxing and Tennis led with a 74.37% injury occurrence rate. Basketball followed closely at 73.76% and Football had an injury rate of 73.71%
* Minor injury occured most with a total of 7472 cases followed by moderate injury-5262 cases and severe injury 2246 cases

* Achilles injuries had the longest average recovery time: 54 days and Contusion followed closely with 51 days
* Rest led the way with a recovery speed index of 2.15% followed by ice/heat therapy - 2.13% and surgery 2.10%
* Contusion injuries had the highest recurrence rate at 23.09% followed by Wrist strains 21.68% and back strains 21.42%
* Even minor injuries showed a 20.03% recurrence rate, suggesting they might not be as "minor" as often assumed.

# Recommendations 

* Age and gender-specific injury prevention programs could reduce injury frequency and severity.
* Minor injuries should be treated with as much care as severe ones, given their high recurrence.
* Recovery planning should prioritize rest and physical therapy, which showed high effectiveness.
